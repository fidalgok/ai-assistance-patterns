# Strategic Insights (Optional Stage)

**Purpose:** Provide value-added analysis beyond what was explicitly discussed—pattern recognition, risk identification, and strategic recommendations.

**When:** After core stages are complete. Most useful for operations mode but can apply to content mode.

**Mode:** Works with either Operations or Content processing.

## Process

1. Consider the stated purpose of the meeting/content
2. Identify patterns across different discussion points
3. Surface opportunities or risks not explicitly discussed
4. Connect dots between separate topics
5. Provide strategic recommendations

## Prompt Pattern

```
Based on this [meeting type/content type], provide 3-5 strategic insights:

These should:
- Go beyond what was explicitly stated
- Connect ideas across different parts of the discussion
- Identify opportunities, risks, or patterns the participants may not have noticed
- Help the team/reader move forward more effectively

For each insight:

**Insight [N]: [Descriptive Title]**
[2-3 sentences explaining the insight, why it matters, and what to do about it]

Look for:
- Recurring themes or concerns that weren't directly addressed
- Gaps between stated goals and discussed actions
- Dependencies or risks that weren't acknowledged
- Opportunities for leverage or efficiency
- Connections between seemingly unrelated topics
```

## Output

3-5 strategic insights with clear titles, explanations, and implications.

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Insights go beyond restating what was said
- [ ] Each insight has a clear "so what" implication
- [ ] Patterns and connections are supported by evidence from the transcript
- [ ] Insights are actionable, not just observations
- [ ] Risks and opportunities are both represented where relevant
