# AI Literacy Connections (Optional Stage)

**Purpose:** Connect the content's insights to AI fluency concepts—how these ideas apply to human-AI collaboration.

**When:** After core content stages. Most relevant for content mode, especially educational material.

**Mode:** Primarily Content, but can apply to Operations if relevant.

## Why This Stage Exists

Many topics have natural connections to AI literacy:
- Communication skills → prompting and delegation
- Critical thinking → discernment and evaluation
- Coaching frameworks → system prompt design
- Decision-making → human-AI task allocation

This stage makes those connections explicit and teachable.

## Process

1. Identify analogies between the content topic and AI interactions
2. Suggest AI tool designs inspired by the content (e.g., custom GPTs, system prompts)
3. Extract "human skills" that remain critical in an AI-augmented world
4. Connect to existing AI fluency frameworks (4Ds, mental models, etc.)

## Prompt Pattern

```
Synthesize "AI Literacy Teachable Moments" based on this content:

1. **Analogies**
   How does [Topic from the content] apply to interacting with LLMs?
   Example: "Active listening parallels how we should engage with AI output—not just accepting, but probing and clarifying."

2. **AI Tool Design**
   If we built an AI assistant based on this expert's methodology, what would it look like?
   - Draft a mini system prompt (5-10 lines) capturing the core approach
   - Suggest what the tool would be good for and its limitations

3. **Durable Human Skills**
   What capabilities from this content remain distinctly human and become MORE important with AI augmentation?
   - Judgment and discernment
   - Emotional intelligence
   - Ethical reasoning
   - Domain expertise for validation

4. **Framework Connections**
   How does this content connect to AI fluency frameworks?
   - The 4Ds (Delegation, Description, Discernment, Diligence)
   - Mental models (brilliant intern, right-loading, evaluative layer)
   - Human-centered AI principles

Format as "AI Literacy & Fluency Teachable Moments" with clear sections.
```

## Output

Structured connections between the content and AI literacy concepts, including analogies, tool design ideas, and framework links.

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Analogies are illuminating, not forced
- [ ] System prompt draft captures the essence of the approach
- [ ] Human skills identified are genuinely durable
- [ ] Connections to 4Ds and mental models are accurate
- [ ] Someone learning AI fluency would find this useful
