# Stage 3: Practical Applications

**Purpose:** Translate insights into actionable experiments for the reader/learner. This replaces the "action items table" from operations mode.

**When:** After Stage 2 framework deep dives.

## Key Distinction

In operations mode, action items are assigned to meeting participants ("John will follow up on X").

In content mode, applications are designed for the **reader/learner**—someone consuming this content who wants to apply it in their own context.

## Process

1. Identify the target audience (educators, managers, designers, etc.)
2. Create specific "try this" experiments
3. Suggest mindset shifts or beliefs to challenge
4. Recommend habits or recurring practices
5. Keep applications concrete and low-barrier

## Prompt Pattern

```
Translate these insights into "Practical Applications" for [Target Audience, e.g., Educators, Managers, Designers].

Create 3-5 specific experiments or practices they can adopt:

1. **The "Tomorrow" Experiment**
   Something small to try immediately—low risk, quick feedback.

2. **The Mindset Shift**
   A belief or assumption to challenge based on this content.

3. **The Habit**
   A recurring practice to build over time (e.g., "The 2-week Energy Audit", "Daily 5-minute reflection").

4. **The Conversation**
   A discussion to have with a colleague, team, or mentor based on these ideas.

5. **The Deep Dive**
   Further learning or exploration for someone who wants to go deeper.

Format as:

### Practical Applications for [Audience]

**[Application Title]**
[Clear instruction on what to do, when, and how to know if it's working]

Keep applications specific and actionable. "Try active listening" is too vague. "In your next 1:1, ask 'What else?' three times before offering solutions" is concrete.
```

## Output

3-5 concrete applications tailored to the target audience, with clear instructions for each.

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Applications are specific and actionable (not vague advice)
- [ ] Mix of quick experiments and longer-term practices
- [ ] Tailored to the specified audience
- [ ] Each application has clear "how to do it" instructions
- [ ] Barriers to trying are low
