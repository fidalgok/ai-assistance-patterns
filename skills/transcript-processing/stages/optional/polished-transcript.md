# Polished Transcript (Optional Stage)

**Purpose:** Create a clean, readable version of the original dialogue for archival or sharing.

**When:** On request, or when the original transcript is particularly messy. Works with either mode.

**Mode:** Works with either Operations or Content processing.

## When to Use This

- Original transcript has many filler words, false starts, or incomplete sentences
- You want a shareable record of the conversation
- Archival purposes where readability matters
- Creating quotable excerpts for articles or presentations

## Process

1. Remove filler words ("um," "uh," "like," "you know," "sort of")
2. Complete partial sentences and fix grammar
3. Preserve speaker attribution throughout
4. Maintain natural conversational flow
5. Keep ALL substantive content—only remove verbal noise

## Prompt Pattern

```
Rewrite the transcript into a cleaned-up, readable dialogue:

Requirements:
- Remove filler words and verbal tics (um, uh, like, you know, sort of, kind of)
- Fix grammar and complete partial sentences
- Preserve speaker attribution for every statement
- Maintain the natural flow of conversation
- Keep ALL substantive content—only remove verbal noise, not ideas

Format as:

**[Speaker Name]:** [Cleaned dialogue]

**[Speaker Name]:** [Cleaned dialogue]

Continue throughout the transcript.

Important:
- Don't change what people said, just how clearly it reads
- Preserve personality and speech patterns where they add character
- Keep technical terms and jargon as spoken
- Maintain the back-and-forth rhythm of conversation
```

Clean, readable transcript formatted as attributed dialogue. Suitable for archival, sharing, or extracting quotes.
