# Stage 2: Framework Deep Dives

**Purpose:** Turn identified concepts into actionable guides and analyze any demos/roleplays as case studies.

**When:** After Stage 1 lesson plan extraction.

## Process

### For Each Framework Identified

1. Name it clearly
2. Break down the steps or components
3. Extract specific scripting (actual phrases to use)
4. Identify anti-patterns (what NOT to do)

### For Demos, Roleplays, or Coaching Sessions

If Stage 0 flagged any live demonstrations:

1. Describe the scenario
2. Identify the intervention (what technique was applied)
3. Note the result (how did the recipient respond/shift)
4. Extract the meta-lesson (why did this work)

## Prompt Pattern

```
Flesh out the identified frameworks into actionable guides:

**For each Framework** (e.g., GROW Model, 4Ds):
- **Name:** [Framework name]
- **Purpose:** [What problem does it solve / when to use it]
- **Steps:** [Step 1, Step 2, Step 3...]
- **Scripting:** [Actual phrases to use, e.g., "Help me understand...", "What would success look like?"]
- **Anti-Pattern:** [What NOT to do, common mistakes]

**For any Case Studies/Demos** identified in Stage 0:
- **The Scenario:** [Brief context—who was involved, what was the situation]
- **The Intervention:** [What technique or approach did the expert apply?]
- **The Result:** [How did the recipient respond? What shifted?]
- **The Meta-Lesson:** [Why did this work? What principle does it illustrate?]

Be specific and practical. Someone should be able to apply these frameworks after reading this.
```

## Output

Detailed how-to guides for each framework, plus case study analyses for any demonstrations or roleplays.

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Each framework has clear, numbered steps
- [ ] Scripting includes actual phrases, not just descriptions
- [ ] Anti-patterns are specific and actionable
- [ ] Case studies capture what happened AND why it worked
- [ ] Someone unfamiliar with the content could apply these
