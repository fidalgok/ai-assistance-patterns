# Stage 1: Lesson Plan Extraction

**Purpose:** Extract the core curriculum or "syllabus" of the conversation—treat it as a masterclass, not a meeting.

**When:** After Stage 0 clarifications are resolved.

## Process

1. Ignore "agenda items" or "status updates"—focus on teachable content
2. Extract **Concepts** (the "what")
3. Extract **Frameworks and Mental Models** (the "how")
4. Capture **Key Definitions** and terminology
5. Note "tweetable quotes" or memorable phrasings

## What to Look For

- **Acronyms and named frameworks:** GROW, OFNR, 4Ds, etc.
- **Step-by-step processes:** "First you... then you..."
- **Distinctions:** "The difference between X and Y is..."
- **Definitions:** "What I mean by [term] is..."
- **Principles:** "The key thing to remember is..."

## Prompt Pattern

```
Extract the "Curriculum" of this conversation. Treat this not as a meeting but as a Masterclass.

Identify:

1. **Core Concepts** (The "What")
   - What are the main ideas or topics being taught?
   - What terminology is introduced or defined?

2. **Mental Models & Frameworks** (The "How")
   - Look for acronyms (e.g., GROW, OFNR) or step-by-step processes
   - Identify any named methodologies or approaches
   - Note distinctions being drawn (X vs. Y)

3. **Key Definitions**
   - How do they define important terms?
   - What distinctions do they make? (e.g., "Coaching vs. Advising")

4. **Quotable Insights**
   - Memorable phrasings or "tweetable" statements
   - Counterintuitive observations

Format as a bulleted "Lesson Plan" organized by these categories.
```

## Output

A structured "curriculum" that captures what someone could learn from this content, organized by concepts, frameworks, definitions, and quotable insights.

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Core concepts are identified and clearly stated
- [ ] Frameworks are named and briefly described
- [ ] Key terms are defined as the speaker defines them
- [ ] Quotable insights capture memorable phrasings
- [ ] The output reads like a lesson plan, not meeting notes
