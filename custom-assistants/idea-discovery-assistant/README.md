This is a workshop helper assistant that we've used for AI fluency training on how to create and use custom assistants. The target audience for this particular assistant is Boston College faculty and staff.

Here's how to implement this yourself.

# **How to Use IDA: Your Idea Discovery Assistant**

## **What IDA Does**

IDA helps you **brainstorm ideas** for a custom AI assistant you might build. Think of it as a creative thinking partner—here to help you explore possibilities, not to build anything yet.

[Here’s the link to IDA to start chatting.](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1M0twN5UKYzCBao9yoXQV69XJ2wG88gjX?usp=sharing)

_Tip: Make sure you select “Pro” as the model to talk to._

**IDA will:**

- Ask questions to understand your work and challenges
- Suggest assistant concepts based on what you share
- Help you refine and simplify ideas
- Keep things scoped for a realistic prototype

**IDA won't:**

- Write your system prompt (that's Module 2\)
- Tell you what to build
- Suggest anything requiring sensitive data or complex systems

## **How to Start**

You don't need a fully-formed idea. Just start talking. Here are some ways in:

### If you're not sure where to begin:

"I'm not sure what to build. Can you help me figure out what might be useful?"

### If you have a vague sense:

"I keep thinking about \[topic/challenge\], but I'm not sure what an assistant would actually do."

### If you have a specific frustration:

"I spend way too much time on \[task\]. Could an assistant help with that?"

### If you want to explore:

"What kinds of assistants do people typically build for \[context\]?"

## **Starter Prompts by Role**

**Faculty / Instructors:**

- "My students always struggle with \[X\]. Could an assistant help them?"
- "I want to give better feedback but I don't have time. Any ideas?"
- "I explain the same concepts over and over. What could help?"

**Staff:**

- "I answer the same questions constantly. Is there an assistant for that?"
- "We have a complicated process people always get wrong. Could AI help?"
- "I need help staying organized with \[recurring task\]."

**Students:**

- "I get stuck when I'm writing and don't know what to do next."
- "I want something to help me study or prepare for \[X\]."
- "I need help understanding \[complex topic\] in my own words."

**Anyone:**

- "What's one thing in my work that feels repetitive or tedious?"
- "If I could have help with anything, what would be fun to try?"

## **The Conversation Flow**

A typical IDA conversation moves through these phases:

```
1. SURFACE THE NEED
   What's the challenge? What frustrates you? What would help?
        ↓
2. GENERATE IDEAS
   IDA suggests 1-2 assistant concepts based on what you shared
        ↓
3. REFINE THE CONCEPT
   Who is it for? What does it do? What does success look like?
        ↓
4. SCOPE IT DOWN
   What's the simplest version we could try first?
```

You don't have to follow this exactly—let the conversation go where it needs to go.

## **Two Types of Assistants**

As you brainstorm, one frame that helps some folks is that it helps to know what kind of assistant you're imagining:

| Process-Oriented                   | Product-Oriented               |
| :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| The value is in the _conversation_ | The value is in the _output_   |
| Tutors, coaches, reflection guides | Drafters, summarizers, editors |
| Helps you think more clearly       | Helps you create something     |
| "Walk me through this"             | "Give me a draft of this"      |

Either type is great\! Knowing which you're building helps you design it better.

## **Tips for a Good Conversation**

**Be specific about your context.** "I teach a 200-person intro course" is more useful than "I'm a teacher."

**Think about a real scenario.** "Last week I spent 3 hours doing X" grounds the conversation.

**It's okay to change direction.** "Actually, let's try something different" is totally fine.

**Simple is better.** The best first prototypes do one thing well.

**You can come back.** IDA is here whenever you want to brainstorm more.

## **When You're Done**

You've got a solid concept when you can answer:

- **What does this assistant do?** (one clear job)
- **Who is it for?** (you, your students, your team?)
- **What would a typical interaction look like?**
- **What would it need to know?** (and do you have access to that info?)

You don't need a perfect answer to every question—just enough to start designing in Module 2\.

Take a look at the [system prompt for the IDA assistant](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kkaO-v7CSmAvxP_8qAxhS0W5sRGBXryCSTO5ukO2FZA/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.hz6djwp752j6) and see what you notice after having used it.

## **Fun Feature: Off Menu Mode**

Type `--offmenu` to unlock a special mode that changes IDA's tone. We won't spoil the fun, but suggest giving it a try\!

And don't worry, you'll get the same brainstorming help, different flavor. Type "reset" to go back to normal.

Browse the AI Test Kitchen resource library:

- [**Roles Gallery**](https://future-cymbal-42b.notion.site/Roles-198317d18ec780948812c9762f54b7e6) – Categories of assistant types (tutors, coaches, editors, planners, and more) with descriptions of what each does
- [**Example System Prompts**](https://future-cymbal-42b.notion.site/Examples-198317d18ec780e88336dc3800b47217) – Real examples of custom assistants others have built

These are great for sparking ideas or seeing what's possible. You can browse before talking to IDA, or IDA might point you to specific examples during your conversation.
