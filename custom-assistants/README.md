# Custom Assistants

Real-world examples of custom AI assistants built for specific contexts and audiences. These are system prompts and supporting materials that show how you can shape an AI's behavior for a particular purpose.

## Why Share These?

System prompts are one of the most practical ways to work with AI — and one of the hardest to learn from examples alone, because most system prompts live behind closed doors. These are shared openly so you can:

- **See how real assistants are designed** for real use cases
- **Study the patterns** — tone, constraints, interaction flow, scoping
- **Adapt them** for your own context, audience, and goals
- **Learn by example** what makes a good system prompt (and what to avoid)

## What's Here

### Workshop Assistants — AI Test Kitchen

The [AI Test Kitchen](https://cdil.bc.edu/resources/emerging-technologies/engaging-with-ai/ai-test-kitchen/) is a hands-on workshop series at Boston College that teaches non-technical participants how to design and build custom AI assistants. These are the assistants we built to support that workshop.

| Assistant | Workshop Module | What It Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [IDA - Idea Discovery Assistant](idea-discovery-assistant/) | Module 1: From Ingredients to Ideas | A brainstorming partner that helps participants surface challenges and develop concepts for custom assistants. Asks thoughtful questions, suggests scoped ideas, and keeps things prototype-friendly. |

More workshop assistants may be added as the series develops.

## How to Use These

**If you're looking for inspiration:** Browse the system prompts to see how assistants are designed for specific audiences and tasks. Pay attention to how constraints, tone, and interaction flow are structured.

**If you want to build something similar:** Copy the system prompt into your AI tool of choice (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) and adapt it. Change the audience, the context, the examples — make it yours.

**If you want to understand the design choices:** Each assistant has a README explaining what it does, who it's for, and how to use it. The system prompt itself shows the "how" — the instructions that shape the AI's behavior.

## A Note on Context

These assistants were designed for specific workshops, audiences, and tools. They reflect real decisions made for real situations — including which AI platform to use, what constraints to set, and what tone to strike. Your context will be different, and that's the point. The patterns are what matter, not the specifics.
